## Code systems

* United States Postal Service (USPS)
    * ZIP codes
* Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes
    * States
    * Counties
* Social Security Administration (SSA) Codes
    * States
    * Counties

## Mapping sources

Mapping between FIPS and SSA codes is available from
[National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://www.nber.org/research/data/ssa-federal-information-processing-series-fips-state-and-county-crosswalk)

Mapping between FIPS and ZIP codes we have taken from
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R)
[ZIP crosswalk files](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html)

## Python and SQL Code

Two utilities are provided to downloaded mapping files from
sources and load them into the database:

* Python module to download and ingest NBER FIPS <-> SSA mapping files:
    [ssa2fips](members/ssa2fips)
* Python module to download and ingest HUD ZIP to FIPS mappings:
    [zip2fips](members/zip2fips)
* DDL for HUD ZIP to FIPS mappings:
    [hud_zip2fips.ddl](members/hud_zip2fips)
* SQL to create direct ZIP => FIPS lookup table and helper functions:
    [zip2fips.sql](members/zip2fips.sql)

## Tables and Functions

All tables and functions are in schema "public".

### Tables

* `ssa`
* `hud_zip2fips`
* MATERIALIZED VIEW `public.zip2fips` for direct lookups

(territorial-codes-functions)=
### Functions 
                                                            
The functions below are defined in [zip2fips.sql](members/zip2fips.sql)
and used to map zip codes to county FIPS codes or to validate that a given
combination of zip code and county code exists.

* `public.zip_to_fips(year int, zip int) RETURNS int`. This function 
    looks for all counties that intersect the provided zip code area in 
    the given year. 
    The intersecting counties are then sorted by the ratio of residential 
    addresses within the zip code area that fall into each county. The 
    county with the highest ratio is selected as the return value. The FIPS
    code for such county is returned as an integer.
* `public.zip_to_fips3(year int, zip int) RETURNS varchar(3)` - the same as
    the above, but return value is a 3-character string (VARCHAR(3)) padded by 
    zeros.
* `public.is_zip_to_fips_exact(year int, zip int) RETURNS bool` returns
    `true` if county fips code can be unambiguously inferred from the given
    zip code in the given year, `false` otherwise. In particular this function
    return `false` if a `year` is missing from mapping files.
* `public.validate_zip_fips(zip int, fips2 varchar, fips3 varchar) RETURNS bool`
    returns true if a given combination of the codes is a valid combination,
    i.e. if there are exist (or ever existed) any residential, business or 
    other addresses in the given state and county that have the
    given zip code.
