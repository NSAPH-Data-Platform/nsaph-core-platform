# NSAPH Data Platform Core

## Overview
The data platform provides generic infrastructure for NSAPH Data Platform
It depends on nsaph_util package, but it augments it
with APIs and command line utilities dependent on the infrastructure 
and the environment. For instance, its components assume presence of PostgreSQL
DBMS (version 13 or later) and CWL runtime environment.

The package is under intensive development, therefore its 
development branches contain some obsolete modules and utilities.
The project structure can also be in flux.
